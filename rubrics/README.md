#Grading Policies

<h1>General grading policy </h1>

Labs, assignments, and exams we are responsible for grading are all graded out of 10 points. 

The students have up to a week to submit an assignment or lab late.

If their work is submitted within 48 hours beyond the deadline, 0.5 pt will be deducted.
If their work is submitted after 48 hours beyond the deadline, an additional point will be deducted for each day late. The hard cut-off for each day late is 11:59 pm.
If the student submits any later than a week, then they get a zero for their work.

<h2> Lateness summary </h2>

48 hrs late: -0.5 pts
3 Days late: -1 pts
4 Days late: -2 pts
5 days late: -3 pts
6 days late: -4 pts
7 days late: -5 pts
8+ days late: -10 pts

<h2> Compilation Errors </h2>

We also take off 2 points if their code does not compile, even for the smallest of errors, and continue grading as normal. They have been warned to make sure their code compiles, even if it is submitted incomplete.
