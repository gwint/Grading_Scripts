interface Classifications and Actions (worth 0.5)
	-3 abstract methods present in Classifications
	-4 abstract methods present in Actions

correct abstract/concrete and extends/implements (worth 0.5)
	abstract Animal implements Classifications, Actions
	abstract Carnivore extends Animal
	abstract Herbivore extends Animal
	concrete Tiger extends Carnivore
	concrete AnimalComparator implements Comparator<Animal>


abstract Animal (worth 1 point) 
	-0.25 overrides toString method with proper retVal
	-0.25 added abstract String getAnimalName()
	-0.25 private static Comparator<Animal> animalComp is present, and implemented as a lambda expression properly
	-0.25 getter method, getComp(), for animalComp is present

abstract Carnivore (worth 1 point)
	-0.25 abstract method prowl() present
	-0.25 value constructor present to set fields, prey and predatoryLevel
	-0.25 overrides toString properly
	-0.25 getters for prey and predatoryLevel are present

abstract Heribvore (worth 1 point)
	-0.25 abstract method graze() present
	-value constructor present to set fields, foilage and aggressionLevel
	-0.25 overrides toString properly
	-0.25 getters for foilage and aggressionLevel are present

concrete Tiger (worth 2.0 points)
	-0.25 value cosntructor initializes fields in Carnivore using super, and sets Tiger's name field
	-0.25 overrides toString() properly
	-1.5 various methods each worth 0.15
		-0.15 implements getAnimalName() properly
		-0.15 implements speak() properly

		-0.15 implements kingdom() properly
		-0.15 implements genus() properly
		-0.15 implements species() properly
		-0.15 implements prowl() properly
		-0.15 getName() present and correct

concrete AnimalComparator (worth 1.5 points)
	-1.0 implements compare() 
		-0.25 handles case where both animals are herbivores
			-compares based on aggressionLevels
		-0.25 handles cases where one animal is prey of the other
			-the predatory is considered greater than the prey
		-0.25 handles case where both are Carnivores, but don't have a preditory-prey relationship
			-compares based on predatoryLevel
		-0.25 handles case where one is a Herbivore, the other is a carnivore, and they don't have a preditory-prey relationship
			-Herbivore is considered less than the Carnivore
	-0.25 sortAnimals()
		-correctly sorts animals, calling the compare method properly
	-0.25 two utility methods staticCompare() and staticSortAnimals() are present

ComparatorTester (worth 2.5 points)
	-2.0 passes all tests
	-0.25 all staticCompares are replaced with use of animalComp, which should be added before the init() method	
	-0.25 in test13, student updated so list.sort() is using animalComp
