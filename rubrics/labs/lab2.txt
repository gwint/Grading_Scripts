+1 for title getter
+1 for numPages getter
+4 for numPagesInLibrary(Book[]) (2 pts for 2 test cases)
+4 for Library.mostPages(booksArray1) (3 test cases)

For students whose code doesnt compile, I give at most 4 points based on effort.

The only exception is when it doesn't compile due to github merge conflicts. Then I give up to 8 points.

-1 for not including package name
